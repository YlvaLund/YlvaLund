# ðŸ‘‹ Hi - Im Ylva.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: "Ylva Lund",
  sayHi: "What's up!",
};
let interests = [];
interests.push("Knitting");
interests.push("Drawing, Painting");
interests.push("Art and Design");

person.interests = interests;
person.presentation = () => {
  return `${person.sayHi}, my name is ${person.name}.
  
  When I am not working, I find time for my wonderful family and any other free-time I like to use on ${person.interests.map((i) => i)}
  `;
};
